    LessonTree is an open-source, full stack web application which utilizes
    a lesson sharing network in order to redefine how teachers create, edit, &amp; share lesson plans
    amongst other educators &amp; themselves. Our objective centers around maximizing non-teaching time
    outside of the classroom &amp; increasing efficiency. LessonTree’s community network
    promotes accurate &amp; usable rubrics, functional plans, highly vetted documentation,
    &amp; lessens time constraints so that more effective teaching occurs inside the classroom.
    Our collaborative workspace includes in-browser editing of documents &amp; the ability
    to “branch” plans to new projects in order to provide an all-inclusive,
    yet user friendly experience. The best part- it’s free! We hope you enjoy what LessonTree
    has to offer.
